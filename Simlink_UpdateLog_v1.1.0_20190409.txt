Simlink was built 4/9/2019 with some modifiations to be able to run with an optimization algorithm.
The optimization functionality was failing to run previously because somehow the optimization object was not getting initialized.
Both Simlink and OptWrap depend on Nini.dll, however different versions of Nini.dll made it diffficult for these to talk.
This has happened before, and I don't recall the resolution.

In this case, I stripped out all the Nini.dll references and made sure they were all using the same library.
	There was still an issue, but I got it to work.

Other issues:
-Halcrow GA is not finding some configurable file (OptimizationWrapper.xml?) that provides opportunity to set its algo params.
This is not a big deal unless you are fine tuning algorithms, which we are not.
